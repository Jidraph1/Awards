# AwardsAWWARDS
Welcome to the Awards Python web application.

## Description
Awards is a Python-based web application that emulates the popular awards giving web application "Awwwards". Just as the original application, Awwards allows users to sign up and login before commencing with activities such as submiting a site, rating a site or leaving feedback on a site. Users can then post their favourite sites that they have created within the application and be given a rating on the same based on three criteria: Design, Usability and Content. Users also have their own dedicated profile page where they can view their profile information and also the sites that they have posted. The users get to perform these activities on a user-friendly interface similar to the original.

## Setup Instructions
